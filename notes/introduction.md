## Undestanding The Problem
- What is a glomeruli FTU ?
- What are the 5 organs that we will be reviewing to identify and segment FTUs ?
- What is the current process when doing this manually ?
- What is the state of the art in image segmentation ?
- Can an FTE contain another FTU ? Will we need to identify both ?

## Development Considerations
### Basics
- The image files are store in `.tiff` format, how can those be read in python ?
